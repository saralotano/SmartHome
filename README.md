# SmartHome
Networked Embedded Systems Course Project

The wireless sensor network consists of a base station connected to the electric grid, a node representing a smart oven and another node representing a smart window.
The code was flashed on CC2659 Launchpads and the OS used for this resource-constrained networked embedded system is Contiki-NG.
